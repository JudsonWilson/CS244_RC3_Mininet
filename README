This is a series of tests written by Sam Crognale and Judson Wilson to test
results from the paper Mittal et. al. (2014) "Recursively Cautious Congestion
Control."

To setup and run the experiment:

1. Launch an Amazon EC2 instance, using the public AMI named
   CS244-Spr15-RC3-Mininet-Experiement-v#, where # is a version number. You
   will need to configure your security group to open inbound traffic on the
   standard ssh port 22, and may wish to also open port 8000 to view results
   files using a web server interface.

2. SSH into the instance using the public DNS URL and the username "ubuntu".

3. Run either the "short" test or the "full" test, by running either
   ./run_short.sh or ./run_full.sh. The difference is the number of iterations
   each FCT test is run for each protocol and flow size. "Short" is
   recommended, performing 3 flows per test, whereas "full" performs 10
   tests which takes considerably longer.

4. Once mininet shuts down and display the "Done" message, the results are
   ready in a subdirectory called "results-short-<timestamp>" or
   "results-full-<timestamp>".

5. You can view the plot files, with names of format "figure-##.png", in many
   ways, including:
     * Starting the python web server using "python -m SimpleHTTPServer &". You
       can now browse the contents of the folder via web address
       "http://serverip:8000", where serverip is the ip address of your EC2
       instance. This requires having port 8000 open for inbound traffic on
       your EC2 Security Group.
     * Calling "feh image-##.png", where "image-##.png" is the name of the
       image file. This uses the feh image viewer to open the image. It
       requires that you are connected with a terminal that supports X11
       forwarding and that your ssh connection has trusted X11 forwarding
       enabled (ssh -Y).
     * File transfer methods, such as SCP, to transfer the file to your local
       machine.
